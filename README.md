I'm a philosopher with an interest in applied ontology. I also have interests in moral and political philosophy, escpecially the ethics of AI and data science. 

I've written papers about taxonomies for normative and descriptive sentences, as well as criteria of algorithmic fairness (among other things). You can find these on my website.
